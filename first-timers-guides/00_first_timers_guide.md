# WWCDC Cybersecurity First Timer's Guide

## What's "cybersecurity"?
Cybersecurity is essentially protecting computer systems from attacks and compromise. There are many pillars of cybersecurity, from Threat Intelligence to Risk/Compliance to Forensics to Engineering, there are tons of different opportunities in this field. 

  
## Why should I learn about it? 

Cybersecurity has a significant human impact. The field directly impacts our every day lives, as every industry must take the security of its systems into account. From [recent estimates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/08/09/the-cybersecurity-talent-gap-is-an-industry-crisis/#5bb186d1a6b3), there will be as many as 3.5 million unfilled positions in cybersecurity by 2021. The field is currently 11-14% women, a number we are working to increase. 

This [interactive map](https://www.cyberseek.org/pathway.html) provides a look into some of the common career paths in security and the skills/certifications you'll need to get there. 


## What are some common myths/misconceptions? 
* If I have a career in cybersecurity, I'll be sitting alone in a dark room wearing a hoodie and staring at screens all day. 



## Sounds cool! How can I get started? 
Our events will assume a basic knowledge of programming. However, we are open to programmers of all levels! Check out [these resources](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/guidelines-resources/blob/master/learn_to_program.md) to get started on learning how to code. 

As for programming languages, there are many good ones to learn for security. Below are a few recommendations based on what domain of security you're interested in: 

* Python: scripting and automation of tasks 
* Javascript: web-based exploits and pentesting  
* SQL: exploits like SQL injections 
* C: reverse engineering 
* Assembly: reverse engineering
