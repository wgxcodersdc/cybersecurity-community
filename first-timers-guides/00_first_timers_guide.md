# WWCDC Cybersecurity First Timer's Guide

## What's "cybersecurity"?
Cybersecurity is essentially protecting computer systems from attacks and compromise. There are many pillars of cybersecurity, from Threat Intelligence to Risk/Compliance to Forensics to Engineering, there are tons of different opportunities in this field. 

  
## Why should I learn about it? 

Cybersecurity has a significant human impact. The field directly impacts our every day lives, as every industry must take the security of its systems into account. From [recent estimates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/08/09/the-cybersecurity-talent-gap-is-an-industry-crisis/#5bb186d1a6b3), there will be as many as 3.5 million unfilled positions in cybersecurity by 2021. The field is currently 11-14% women, a number we are working to increase. 

This [interactive map](https://www.cyberseek.org/pathway.html) provides a look into some of the common career paths in security and the skills/certifications you'll need to get there. 


## What are some common myths/misconceptions? 
* If I have a career in cybersecurity, I'll be sitting alone in a dark room wearing a hoodie and staring at screens all day.

   **Reality**: cybersecurity is a collaborative field. You will work with people from all different backgrounds on a variety of projects. 
   
* I need to have a degree in Computer Science.  
  
   **Reality**: there are many different paths to becoming a cybersecurity professional. While it is useful to study Computer Science, there are people in this industry with degrees in psychology, law, mathematics, art history, or are even self taught. The initiative, willingness to learn, and work ethic you have is most important.  
   
* I don't want to code all day, so I shouldn't be in cybersecurity. 

  **Reality**: not all cybersecurity jobs are strictly coding. In addition to traditional engineering roles, there are opportunities available in governance, intelligence, and risk management.


## Sounds cool! How can I get started? 
Our events will focus on the more technical areas of security and will assume a basic knowledge of programming. However, we are open to programmers of all levels! Check out [these resources](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/guidelines-resources/blob/master/learn_to_program.md) to get started on learning how to code. 

As for programming languages, there are many good ones to learn for security. Below are a few recommendations based on what domain of security you're interested in: 

* Python: scripting and automation of tasks 
* Javascript: web-based exploits and pentesting  
* SQL: exploits like SQL injections 
* C: reverse engineering 
* Assembly: reverse engineering
