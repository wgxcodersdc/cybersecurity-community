### What do leads do?

Leads are present to facilitate the study group. They help find hosts, schedule meetups, come up with curriculum, and are also available to ask questions.

### Can I be a lead?

YES! We are always looking for more leads and if you're interested in getting involved in Women Who Code in any capacity talk to one of the leads present!

### How can I contribute without being a lead?

We need lots of help coordinating events. If you want to help out please let us know :)

### Slack

The WWC-DC community uses Slack to keep in touch, share resources, and chat about all things tech. You can use Slack to ask troubleshooting questions or general questions about coding (in any language) and the tech industry. We encourge you to sign up here:  http://bitly.com/womenwhocodedcslack (and read our guide if you need more help - http://bit.ly/slackguide)

### Building Access

Certain building managements requires meetup hosts to let people in and do not encourage them being contacted. Please respect the policy, in case the location requires access to the building contact the group lead if information is provided, or drop a comment on the meetup page. We'll come and get you.

#### All Women Welcome

This study group is intended to be exclusively open for any who identify as women; we are transgender friendly.

Happy hacking! :)
